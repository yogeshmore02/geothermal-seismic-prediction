# 🌋 Balmatt Seismic Warning System & Dashboard

This repository contains a **Hybrid Seismic Warning System** designed to predict significant seismic events (Magnitude > 0.5) within a 48-hour window. It uses a combination of Rule-Based thresholds (for high precision) and Machine Learning anomaly detection (for early warning/high recall) based on a sliding 3-day window of operational metrics.

Included is a Streamlit dashboard (`dashboard.py`) for visualizing operational data and real-time seismic risk warnings.

## ⚠️ Important Data Disclaimer: Dummy Dataset

**The data provided in this repository is entirely synthetic (dummy data).** Because the original operational and seismic data belongs to my university and is strictly confidential, it cannot be shared publicly. To ensure this code can be run, reviewed, and tested by the open-source community, I have generated dummy datasets that perfectly mirror the original structure, column names, and data types.

The following files contain synthetic data:
* `operational_metrics.csv`: Simulated hourly injection/production flow, pressure, temperature, and energy metrics.
* `seismic_events_1.csv`: Simulated chronological seismic events with randomized magnitudes, GIS locations, and IDs.
* `risk_log.csv`: Simulated traffic-light warning logs (Green, Yellow, Red) generated by the system.

*Note: Because the data is randomly generated, the predictive accuracy or physical correlation of the machine learning models trained on this specific dataset will not reflect real-world physics. It is provided purely to demonstrate the data engineering pipeline and software architecture.*

## 🛠️ Project Structure

* **`dashboard.py`**: The main Streamlit application for monitoring risks.
* **`train_hybrid.py` / `train_hybrid_v2.py`**: Scripts to train the core hybrid rule-based and ML anomaly detection models.
* **`train_hybrid_3day.py`**: Trains the sliding 3-day window Random Forest model.
* **`predictor_3day.py`**: The inference script used by the dashboard to make predictions on new data.
* **`check_missing.py`**: A utility script to analyze operational datasets for shutdown periods.
* **`requirements.txt`**: Python dependencies required to run the project.
